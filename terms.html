            <div class="header-info">
                <p>Welcome to Unlimited Express Inc. These Terms and Conditions outline the rules and
                    regulations for using our services and website. By accessing our services, you agree to comply
                    with these terms. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please refrain from using our
                    services. These Terms and Conditions govern the use of the services provided by Unlimited Express Inc, including
                    freight delivery and access to our website. By engaging with our services,
                    you agree to abide by these terms.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>Scope of Services</h2>
            <p>Our company specializes in transporting general freight across the United States. We
                work with owner-operators to fulfill transportation needs and provide dispatch services to
                coordinate and secure freight loads. The terms outlined here apply to all aspects of our service
                delivery, including booking, dispatch, and communications. Any special arrangements outside
                the scope of standard services must be agreed upon in writing.
            </p>

            <h2>Owner-Operator Obligations</h2>
            <p>Owner-operators are independent contractors responsible for maintaining their vehicles,
                securing required licenses, and ensuring compliance with all federal, state, and local
                transportation laws. They must carry the necessary insurance for liability, cargo, and property
                damage as specified in their agreements with Unlimited Express Inc. Failure to meet these
                obligations may result in termination of the contractual relationship.
            </p>

            <h2>Dispatch Services</h2>
            <p>Our dispatch services include finding and coordinating loads for owner-operators,
                facilitating communication with brokers and shippers, and providing support during the
                transportation process. Dispatch services are provided under a separate agreement that
                outlines fees, responsibilities, and terms specific to these services.
            </p>

            <h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>
            <p>While we strive to ensure timely and secure delivery, Unlimited Express Inc is not
                responsible for delays, losses, or damages caused by factors outside our control, such as
                natural disasters, accidents, or third-party interference. For owner-operators, liability for cargo or
                damages is governed by their independent agreements and insurance coverage.
            </p>

            <h2>Data and Privacy</h2>
            <p>By using our services, you consent to the collection and use of your personal and business
                information as outlined in our Privacy Policy. We prioritize the security of your data and comply
                with applicable data protection laws.
